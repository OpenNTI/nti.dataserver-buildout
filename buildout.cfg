# Versioning:
# From the docs:
# 	You can specify a url with a revision pin, like http://example.com/trunk@123.
# 	You can also set the rev or revision option, which is either a pin
# 	like with rev=123 or a minimum revision like rev=>123 or rev=>=123.
# 	When you set a minimum revision, the repository is updated when the
# 	current revision is lower.
# We've noticed that using the option doesn't initially check out that version, only
# subsequent updates (re-run of buildout) will switch to that version. Therefore,
# the syntax in the URL is preferred, which means we cannot have a space
# You can also set update=false to manually manage updating a checkout.
