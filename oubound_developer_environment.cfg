# These later give us a command that can be used to document code
# and, more importantly, registered utilities:
#   static-apidoc -v 1 -b -l -p /tmp/apidoc
# It takes some minor surgery to zope.app.apidoc.bookmodule (to remove
# things that aren't there anymore) and zape.app.apidoc.configure.zcml
# (to load nti.appserver and provide a feature so we don't conflict)

# We would like to be able to use zope.testrunner for its robust
# support of layers, auto-coverage, profiling, memory leak support,
# etc. But it's fatal flaw, compared to nose, is that it doesn't
# support test functions (or test generators); it only supports test
# methods inside test classes, and it doesn't support setUpClass
# fixtures (the preference is for layers). Until we eliminate those,
# we're stuck with nose or nose2.

# nose2 supports layers, but notice that layers require test classes
# (not test functions) so transitioning to layers is naturally
# a transition to zope.testrunner too...nose2 is transitional.
# Unfortunately, nose2 at 0.4.7 (release version as-of 2014-02-19)
# has a bad constraint on six, so we must check it out
