####
# Pillow
# We want to build it to use our same versions of zlib
# and libjpeg. Sadly, on OS X, it forcibly inserts
# the paths provided by homebrew and MacPorts into the library
# list and will always choose those in preference to what we
# put in the environment.
# So because of that, on OS X we're better off simply
# using the pre-built binary wheels, which would link to the system
# libraries...but buildout only install eggs from source, so
# we're back to getting the MacPorts libraries if they're installed.
# In short, on OS x, we have no way of knowing which libraries
# we're going to get...it depends on whether you have things installed
# with MacPorts or not.
